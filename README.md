# Enigma Code Investigation

This repository contains my investigation of the Enigma cipher machine.

## Files

- **`Enigma.sws`** - Original Sage worksheet (requires SageMath to run)
- **`Enigma_Investigation.ipynb`** - Jupyter notebook version for viewing on GitHub

## Important Notes

The code in this investigation was originally written in **SageMath**, which has specialized mathematical functions not available in standard Python. 

- The `.sws` file will run properly in a Sage environment
- The `.ipynb` file shows the same code and explanations but may not execute in standard Python/Jupyter environments
- Both files contain identical mathematical content and reasoning

## Viewing the Work

For the best viewing experience on GitHub, check out the `.ipynb` file which displays formatted text, code, and mathematical explanations.
